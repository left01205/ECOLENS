## Introduction

The global proliferation of electronic gadgets has resulted in a staggering surge of electrical and electronic devices being discarded annually, giving rise to an escalating e-waste crisis. The World Health Organization (WHO) highlights the severe environmental and health consequences of improper e-waste management, linking adverse outcomes during pregnancy and childhood to exposure to informal recycling practices. Despite the urgency of this global challenge, previous e-waste management solutions have fallen short in addressing critical issues, including user awareness, proper disposal practices, and the lack of effective tools to tackle the crisis.

This repository introduces EcoLens, an innovative AI-powered application designed to revolutionize e-waste management. EcoLens leverages cutting-edge computer vision technology to identify electronic components, categorize them based on hazardous levels, and detect the presence of toxic materials. The application employs a data-driven approach crucial for crafting targeted solutions that align with the recommendations set forth by international agencies.

## E-Waste Crisis Overview

According to the Global E-Waste Monitor, over 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste were generated globally in 2021, representing a 21 percent increase in just five years. This data underscores the urgent need for comprehensive e-waste management solutions. Previous products have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth in e-waste, and as a result, the environmental and health impacts of improper disposal have become increasingly pronounced.

## Features and Functionality

### Intelligent Approach to E-Waste Management

EcoLens employs a data-driven approach to identify and categorize electronic components, providing users with clear, step-by-step instructions for proper disposal. By actively engaging users in the disposal process, EcoLens addresses the root causes of improper e-waste management.

### User-Friendly Interface

Implementing EcoLens is designed to be user-friendly. Users can simply download the EcoLens app on their smartphones, allowing them to utilize the power of computer vision for e-waste management. Upon opening the app, users point their phone cameras at electronic components they wish to identify. EcoLens then utilizes its advanced algorithms to recognize and categorize these components, providing users with information on their environmental impact and instructions on proper disposal methods.

### Impact on Health and Environment

The WHO has identified several health effects linked to e-waste exposure, including adverse neonatal outcomes, neurodevelopmental issues, and respiratory problems. Additionally, the environmental impact is profound, with soil and water contamination resulting from improper disposal methods. EcoLens actively educates users about the potential health and environmental consequences, becoming a powerful tool in promoting global awareness and literacy surrounding e-waste management.

## Goals

Our current goal is to identify components of computers, which the user wants to dispose of and provide the user with the best available course of action to dispose of e-waste without causing great harm to the environment. EcoLens addresses a critical gap in e-waste management by combining technological innovation with user education.

## Conclusion

EcoLens empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their electronic devices, promoting responsible disposal practices and environmental consciousness. By offering a user-friendly interface and actionable insights, EcoLens not only contributes to a cleaner environment but also educates users on the broader implications of their consumption choices. The public stands to benefit by reducing the negative impact of e-waste on both personal health and the planet, making EcoLens a valuable tool for a sustainable future.
